A Self Case Study on Road Damage Detection &amp; Classification using State-of-the-art AI Solutions

This case study is on a real world application of Deep Learning on Making Classification & detection of different kinds of road damages.
This will help the Govt/Municipalities by providing a efficient and cost-effective maintenance way with the goal to preserve Roadâ€™s good and safe condition.

We have applied the end-to-end object detection method based on deep learning to the road surface damage detection problem, and verify its detection accuracy. In particular, we examine whether we can detect eight classes of road damage by applying state-of-the-art object detection methods.
